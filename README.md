# IrcClient
C# .NET Library for an IRC client

This library is my first serious attempt to write something from scratch.

Main design goals are to be able to connect to RFC compliant server and use as many as functionalities possible.
On the other hand I try to make the library as permissive as possible for connecting to some strange IRC implementations (Twitch/Osu!)
